AllChess 1.0

AllChess was created by Connor Lane, Mark David Wood, Max Hartman, Nathan Liu, and Nika Chuzhoy in 2022 as a self-driven project
to develop knowledge in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and algorithmic development. AllChess is a fully-functioning Chess engine including
a few special variants of chess.

= VARIATIONS =

Chess 960, created by former World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer, is a variant that uses the same board and pieces as classical
chess but has the starting positions of the players' back ranks randomized, following certain rules.

Random Queen is a chess variant that employs the same rules and pieces as classical chess, except that every five turns, a random non-King piece transforms into a Queen piece.

Cavalier Chess turns every piece on the board into a knight + x compound.

A simple website was also created for the project and is actively running as of 7/6/22 at allchess.online
